0 148 number of standards. This is the number of calibration standards defined and valid for this line.That means that this the number of standards used for the present calibration. Note: from info 48 until Info 147, all requested (1 in first position here) data will be exported even if the standard is not valid or if  there is no standard. In this last case, “NF”, 0, 0, No, 0 will be exported.
0 149 check this field to specify that you want to export info concerning standards of more than 20 stds. If you put 1 here, standard information for all standards of number >20 will be exported and this field will contain the number of these extra standards, thus the number of following standards.  For each following standards, the information will be exported if the first position is set to 1 in the 5 following lines. These data are:  name of calib standard,  intensity of calib standard, RSD of intensity of calib standard, validity of calib standard and concentration of calib standard. The data will be export between 147 and 148. In this case, advice is given to check the following field)Nota : Following 5 information allow to decide to export or not data of standards (nb >20). The choice is made only once and applied to all  standards>20.
